# Kyle Wong CV

This repository contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDFs for my curriculum vitae. It includes a primary, general CV and several versions tailored for specific industries and roles.

## Navigating CV Versions

You can find the different versions of my CV in two ways:

1.  **Compiled PDFs:** The final, compiled PDF files are organized in the `industry_applications` directory. For example, the CV tailored for quantitative finance roles can be found at `industry_applications/quant_roles/kyle_wong_quant_cv.pdf`. The main, general CV is in the root directory.

2.  **LaTeX Source via Branches:** The LaTeX source for each version is managed on a separate git branch.
    *   The `main` branch contains the source for the general CV.
    *   The `quant-cv-updates` branch contains the source tailored for quantitative finance roles.
    *   Other branches may exist for other specializations.
